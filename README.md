# PowerBI-project--4-week-
  ---Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard in Power BI---
 In this Project we will create comprehensive Dashboard for managing and analyzing supply chain inventory data, manufacturing data and supplier data.

  -- Creating a different tables for a easy to understand or for brief Analysis on the data --
  - Creating a tables with following attribute: 
   
  1. Invectory table:

       - SKU
       - Availability
       - Number of products sold
       - Customer demographics
       - Stock levels
       - Lead times
       - Order quantities
       - Lead time
       - Revenue generated
      
   2. Manufacturing table:
       - Product type
       - SKU
       - Production volumes
       - Manufacturing lead time
       - Manufacturing costs
       - inspection results
       - defect rates

   3. Supplier table:
       - Supplier name
       - Location
       - Lead time
       - Transportation modes
       - Routes
    
   4. Supply chain table:
       - Product type
       - SKU
       - Price
       - Availability
       - Number of products sold
       - Revenue generated
       - Customer demographics
       - Stock levels
       - Lead times
       - Order quantities
       - Shipping times
       - Shipping carriers
       - Shipping name
       - Location
       - Lead time
       - Transportation modes
       - Routes
     
--> Learning Objectives:
1. Understanding Sustainable Supply Chain Metrics
   - Define supply chain sustainability and its importance in business.
2. Data Collection & Preparation
   - Gather and clean sustainability-related data from multiple sources Transform raw data into a structured format for Power BI.
3. Power BI Fundamentals
   - Create a Power BI dashboard with sustainability-related visualizations.
   - Design interactive reports with filters, slicers, and drill-throughs.
4. Data Visualization for Insights
   - Select appropriate visualizations (bar charts, KPIs, trend analysis, maps for carbon footprint tracking).
5. Analyzing and Interpreting Data
   - Perform trend analysis on sustainability KPIs.
   - Identify areas for improvement in the supply chain using data insights.
6. Automating and Sharing Reports
   - Automate data refresh and schedule reports in Power BI Service.
   - Share dashboards with key stakeholders for decision-making.


  
--> Methodology:
The methodology follows a structured approach to collect, process, analyze, and visualize supply chain sustainability data. The key steps include:  
1. Requirement Analysis & KPI Identification
   - Define business objectives and sustainability goals.  
2. Data Collection & Integration  
   - Gather data from databases (Excel, CSVs)  
   - Use Power Query for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean and structure data.  
3. Data Modeling & Calculation
   - Design a data model with relationships between sustainability-related datasets.  
4. Dashboard Design & Visualization
   - Create interactive Power BI reports with charts, KPIs, and geographic heatmaps.  
5. Automation & Real-time Updates
   - Configure Power BI Gateway for automatic data refresh.
6. Security & Deployment
   - Share dashboards via Power BI Service for decision-making.
7. Performance Monitoring & Optimization
   - Refine the dashboard based on user feedback and regulatory requirements.




--> Problem Statements:
